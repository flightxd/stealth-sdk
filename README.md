# Stealth SDK

## What is it?
Stealth is a Software Development Kit, a set of code and tools to help
programmers build beautifully functional applications in Flash. Reflecting the
strengths of the Flash Platform this devkit was designed to be small, fast,
graphic-rich, and work everywhere. So it's perfect for mobile apps and games.
And it works in everyone's favorite tools, like Flash Professional or
Flash Builder, using ActionScript 3 or even MXML!
