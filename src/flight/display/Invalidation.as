	 * The Invalidation utility allows potentially expensive processes, such as
	 * layout, to delay their execution and runs these processes just once each
	 * time the screen is rendered. In the case of layout this delayed execution
	 * is essential, because size and position of parents affect the size and
	 * position of their children and vice versa, through all levels of the
	 * display-list. Invalidation runs in ordered execution by level and
	 * supports any number of custom phases (it is recommended to maintain a
	 * small set of known phases for performance and approachability).

		 * Phases of invalidation such as "measure", "layout" and "draw" allow

		 * (from parent to child). Though phases run in the same render cycle
		 * they are independent from each other and must be invalidated
		 * independently. Finally, each phase supports a unique event dispatched
		 * from the display object which is how systems such as layout execute.
		 * 
		 * For example:
		 * <code>
		 *     // phases only need to be registered once
		 *     Invalidation.registerPhase(LayoutEvent.MEASURE, LayoutEvent, 100);
		 *     
		 *     // invalidate/listen on display objects wanting to support measurement
		 *     Invalidation.invalidate(sprite, LayoutEvent.MEASURE);
		 *     sprite.addEventListener(LayoutEvent.MEASURE, onMeasure);
		 *     
		 *     function onMeasure(event:LayoutEvent):void
		 *     {
		 *         // run measurement code on event.target (the invalidated display object)
		 *     }
		 * </code>
		 * 
		 * @param phaseName		The name by which objects are invalidated and
		 * 						the event type dispatched on their validation.
		 * @param eventType		The event class created and dispatched on
		 * 						validation.
		 * @param priority		Phase priority relating to other phases, where
		 * 						higher priority runs validation first.
		 * @param ascending		Determines order of execution within the phase
		 * 						with ascending from child to parent.

		 * 						for the first time, or re-registered with new
