add 1) color and 2) matrix to base Element's to make transform's more accessible
add better support for MultiDensity (snapToPixel,etc) ... or in general, FIX snapToPixel

1) FXG
2) Gadget demo
3) Layout demo
4) Flash Pro preso
5) Signals
6) Yellowed Paper - lists, sketches, code & demos

move to rely on FP 10.2 with weak-dictionary method-closures
revise binding accordingly - add class/prop listeners without a binding object
test addEventListener memory increase vs creating vector or dictionary listeners array
add signals to components (weak-dictionary, strong-vector) ... smallest memory footprint possible
everything both a signal & an event (hasEventListener)
add clean-up recursive down displaylist for removal
move common code between Display's to utility
revisit layout props on style object (can sit behind ANY displayObject)
revisit every component a container
explore double component approach, both displayObject-in and high-level object definition
!revise IList changeEvents to no-change type, just removedItems, addedItems, beginIndex, endIndex
!extend Array implementing IList - no proxy, still access data, dispatch change on all but list[0] = value


finish skin designer - simple FXG designer, layout, resizing skins, really light





Cursor class needs to be implemented or removed

extend or don't extend all basic Interfaces with IEventDispatcher
	(and dispatch or don't dispatch events from them)

Eliminate [Bindable] autogen tags

review BitmapDisplay constructor
if keeping setSize (measureable) update it with queuebinding
StyleObject
style:Style setter implementation
* consider Behaviors object - proxy, IList or what? add Behaviors:IList updates for when behaviors are added their target is set
update all properties through project with new DataChange


CommunityList:
Nate Beck:
easy "creationComplete" event
disabled state to buttons

Robert Penner:
position:Range -> range:Range
position:Scroll -> scroll:Scroll;


Document RenderPhase
Document IInvalidating
Add generic invalidation as the default (last priority or 0)
complete component lifecycle
FXG completion ... add curved corners
Eliminate requirement of metadata
Bitmap resizing (Jac's approach)
Bitmapmode - cacheAsSpriteSheet


Range:
IRange - min/max
ITrack - min/max,stepSize,pageSize,
IPosition - value,percent,track

list.selection
selection.list
--------
position.track
track.position(s[])
(or just change IScroll to ITrack)
